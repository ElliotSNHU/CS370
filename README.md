Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science

# Summary
Project Two was a pirate treasure game where an agent was placed in one corner of a tilemap and the treasure in another. Walls are placed in a maze-like order and the agent is supposed to be trained to avoid the walls, and reach the treasure. I was given the code that established the maze, agent, and treasure. My task was to write a function that trained the agent within the main loop. 

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists often provide solutions for complex computing problems in the world of technology. It matters because technology has made daily life for the consumer a lot more efficient and easier to navigate. The future of computer science will usher in advanced concepts like artificial intelligence, space exploration, and computing algorithms that may aid in research and development for healthcare, finance, and overall human expansion. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem, I try to break the problem into sections that can be solved incrementally. Planning ahead and creating flow charts, psuedocode, and class diagrams can aid in the software development life cycle. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a developer, my responsibilities are to write secure code, to protect the information of every interactive entity. I must provide ample documentation and follow established coding standards to allow for easy collaboration amongst team members and future developers.
